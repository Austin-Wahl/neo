# Welcome to NEO

NEO is an open source Relational Database Management application. Similar to PG Admin but its browser based and works with all sorts of RDBs.

# Supported Databases

- Postgres

# Getting Started

NEO is self hostable but if your looking to get started fast, head over to [neodb.dev](https://neodb.dev) and signup!

# Why use NEO?

NEO doesn't aim to replace existing tools. It simply aims to make database interacts a bit easier. Rather than having to use multiple complex and resource intensive tools, NEO can handle a lot of the things you'd expect from a DBMS in a simple and modern UI (thanks ShadCN). Its built for develoers and clients.

# Frame of mind

NEO was designed because I (the developer), got tired of having to use different tools to interact with databases. Sure, many providers provide services to interact with a DB via a GUI but it can be a pain having to navigiate between different platforms. My hope is that NEO will make your DX a bit better. I am not trying to reinvent the wheel here.

# How does it work?

NEO abstracts database connections behind the scenes. This means that dispite the differing technical standards RDBs use (think connection strings), NEO is still able to interact with them.
